This package includes:

1) spamData.dat # data set
2) gisette.dat # data set
3) gd.py # gradient descent solver
4) cgd.py # coordinate descent solver
5) newton.py # Newton method solver
5) check_solution.py # python script to check the accuracy of training results
6) plot_iteration.py # python script to plot the iteration history of one optimization
7) report.pdf # the report document
8) houjFunctions/ # modules including functions used by the python solver

To use 3)4)5)6), run "./this_script.py" directly. Those programs are interactive and you can follow the intructions.

To use 6), please run "./plot_iteration.py -f this_is_input_data". Note that you must appoint the input data after "-f".
For instance, after you run a Newton optimization on spamData with epsilon=0.01, there will be generated a file named 
"spamData_newton_f_history_epsilon_0.010000.dat". So you can run "./plot_iteration.py -f spamData_newton_f_history_epsilon_0.010000.dat"
to plot it out. To plot the y axis into logscale, just add word " --log" behind.
